# Miami-Housing-Market-Analysis

This project explores the impact of property features and location on sale prices, using data from 13,932 properties sold in 2016. It highlights that higher quality properties and those with special features like gardens and pools generally command higher prices. The analysis also considers the influence of proximity to points of interest on property values. The study has limitations, including the lack of historical data and current inventory levels.
